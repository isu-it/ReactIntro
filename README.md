React Intro
===========

This sample uses only React.

The MyInput component keeps its own state and doesn't interact outside of itself.

The MyOtherInput component is simpler in that it does not keep any state.  Instead
the component gets its value from the parent and executes a function of the parent
whenever its value changes.

Building and Running:
---------------------
Install the dependencies:
  `npm install`

Run the application:
  `npm start`
